# Swagger Documentation for Joy

This is the REST-API documentation for Joy created with swagger.

## Usage

To use the swagger documentation, import the swagger.yaml into the Swagger Editor (http://editor.swagger.io)

## Important!

Enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to execute request with the Swagger Editor.
In the following link are different approaches from the developer of Swagger to enable CORS: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/docs/cors.md
If their are not working we recommend to use a external tool like Postman to execute and test request and use the swagger.yaml only as a documentation.
